# Memory Card

- A fun game which tests your memory. Do not click the image of any Pokemon more than once or the game will reset. Let's see how good your memory is :D
- Used Vite as bundler, React as library and Vercel for deployment.
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) is the API used in this project. Huge W to them for providing such a good API service for free.
- This is the second project of [React Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/react) in the [Full Stack Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) Course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
